# MyRep!

Personnal project using <strong>javascript... with a little bit of JQuery too..., PHP, and basic HTML/CSS</strong>.

This is my first project, the aim of it is to use different knowledges in an active environement.
Base of this website is to create and administrate repositories.
I wanted something user-friendly, and simple enough to be coded with my own skills.

Some of the features developed for this project are very, very, very basic (such as members account, tag management), but this is the first time I develope something, and I need to code them by myself instead of using plugins.
Nonetheless, some plugins are used (essentially because <strike>I was too lazy to code them</strike> those features are too evolved for me):
<ul>
<li>JS Validation</li>
<li>Summernote</li>
<li>Tooltipster</li>
<li>Word Cloud</li>
<li>CookieBanner</li>
<li>JS Cookie</li>
</ul>
